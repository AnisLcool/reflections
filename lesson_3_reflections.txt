question :When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  answer : when i want to share my repo to public community , or when working with different persons on the same code ,so that 
    they can know about the new updates that i have made


question : 
  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

answer : 
  maybe because we are not sure of how good the functionalities that we added on the remote(commited) , thus we dont want to sync with our local repo automatically , so that's why we do it manually
